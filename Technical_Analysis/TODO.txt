Questions for Dimakis:
 - Am I successfully predicitng future values instead of just given ones
 - Next steps are multivariate, longer range predictions, and a classifier? that will take actions as a metric to compare to holding/dow
 - For predicting a week in advance do I shift by day or by week
 - 

XGB_univariate:
Make the univariate model multivariate 
 - several step required, check the forecasting for ability to handle several variables
 - Set arguments for how much lag, which variables, how far to predict
 - Will also need to change it to predict further than one day
Univariate needs better feature naming when creating a lag for multiple features (use the original name somehow)



General:
Save the data somewhere and update it every week or so or make a function to get new data
 - Need a way to get current price not just yesterdays
 - Data collector should create a csv with TI stock data from yfinance, RSI, MACD, EMA, and whatever other indicators potentially including other tickers


Models:
all models need an evaluate function that returns rmse (for now, later maybe more metrics)
Walk through validation for each model to backtest: https://machinelearningmastery.com/backtest-machine-learning-models-time-series-forecasting/
Out of sample forecasting will be required for actual implementation/implementing trade bot


Things to researrch:
Whisper Number https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/txn
Other stocks to compare ASML (Netherlands) Stepper Manufacturer
TSMC Intel AMD ARM Applied material and Lam research
TI Capacity Constraints (Speed at adding factories, equipment)

April 1st meeting:
Results from model RMSE, which indicators
GUI mockup
Sentimental progress
